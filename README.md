## loop-calculation
This project realizes an emulator for **LOOP** programming language in Java and in a second step also in python.

## LOOP Programming language
The loop programming language is a theoretical programming
language developed by the german computer scientist 
Uwe Sch√∂ning. The syntax of LOOP programs is described 
in his book **Theoretische Informatik - kurz gefasst**, 
which is the standard textbook in the theoretical 
computer science classes at German universities. The key
feature of the LOOP programming language is that the 
functions which a loop program can calculate are exactly
the **primitive recursive functions**.  
A definition of the LOOP syntax can also be found here on
Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOOP_(programming_language)

In this project, we will use a newer syntax definition which is 
equivalent bus easier to understand and to parse. Our Syntax is 
described in an other document (WIP).
